| 200 | 1254066 | UserFieldConvFail | The value corresponding to the personnel field type is incorrect. The possible reasons are: - The ID type specified by the user_id_type parameter does not match the type of the provided ID. - An unrecognized type or structure was provided. Currently, only `id` is supported, and it must be passed as an array. - An `open_id` was passed across applications. If you are passing an ID across applications, it is recommended to use `user_id`. The `open_id` obtained from different applications cannot be used interchangeably. |
